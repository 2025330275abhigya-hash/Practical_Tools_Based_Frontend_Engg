    <h1>Welcome to Web Development</h1>

    <p>
        I'm starting my web development journey to build interactive and useful applications. Learning **HTML** for structure, **CSS** for design, and **JavaScript** for functionality is a foundational skill set for the digital world.

    <p>
        My goal is to eventually create a portfolio website to showcase my projects. Understanding the basic building blocks like headings and paragraphs is the essential first step toward achieving that!
